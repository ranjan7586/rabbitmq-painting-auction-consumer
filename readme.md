To deploy your RabbitMQ worker process using GitHub and Koyeb, I'll guide you through the complete process. I'll start with a basic demo of how to create a RabbitMQ consumer using the `amqplib` package and then show you how to connect GitHub and deploy it on Koyeb.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### 1. **Set Up Your RabbitMQ Consumer (Worker) Locally**

First, let's write a basic RabbitMQ consumer that listens for messages on a queue and processes them.

**File Structure**:
```
/rabbitmq-worker
   ├── package.json
   ├── worker.js
   ├── .env
```

**Step 1.1: Initialize Node.js Project**

```bash
mkdir rabbitmq-worker
cd rabbitmq-worker
npm init -y
npm install amqplib dotenv
```

**Step 1.2: Create `.env` File for Environment Variables**

```plaintext
RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://your_rabbitmq_host
QUEUE_NAME=your_queue_name
```

Make sure you replace `your_rabbitmq_host` with your actual RabbitMQ URL and `your_queue_name` with the name of the queue you want to consume from.

**Step 1.3: Create `worker.js` File**

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const amqp = require('amqplib/callback_api');

// Load environment variables
const RABBITMQ_URL = process.env.RABBITMQ_URL;
const QUEUE_NAME = process.env.QUEUE_NAME;

// Function to consume messages from RabbitMQ
function consumeMessages() {
    amqp.connect(RABBITMQ_URL, (err, connection) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error("Error connecting to RabbitMQ:", err);
            return;
        }

        connection.createChannel((err, channel) => {
            if (err) {
                console.error("Error creating channel:", err);
                return;
            }

            channel.assertQueue(QUEUE_NAME, { durable: true });

            console.log(`Waiting for messages in queue: ${QUEUE_NAME}`);
            channel.consume(QUEUE_NAME, (msg) => {
                if (msg !== null) {
                    console.log("Received message:", msg.content.toString());

                    // Process the message (e.g., save it to a database or log it)
                    // Acknowledge the message after processing
                    channel.ack(msg);
                }
            });
        });
    });
}

// Start consuming messages
consumeMessages();
```

In this code:
- We connect to RabbitMQ using `amqplib`.
- We consume messages from a queue (`QUEUE_NAME`).
- We log the messages and acknowledge them.

#### 2. **Push Code to GitHub**

1. Initialize a git repository in your project folder:

```bash
git init
```

2. Add all files and commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial RabbitMQ worker commit"
```

3. Push it to a GitHub repository:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/rabbitmq-worker.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/rabbitmq-worker.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

#### 3. **Deploy to Koyeb from GitHub**

**Step 3.1: Create a Koyeb Account**
- Sign up at [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/) if you haven't already.

**Step 3.2: Deploy the Worker**

1. **Connect GitHub**: 
   - Go to the Koyeb dashboard.
   - Click on **Create Service**.
   - Choose **GitHub** as the deployment source.
   - Authorize Koyeb to access your GitHub repository.

2. **Select Your Repository**:
   - Once GitHub is connected, choose your `rabbitmq-worker` repository.

3. **Set Build Command**: 
   - Use this build command:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Set Run Command**:
   - Use this run command to start your worker:
     ```bash
     node worker.js
     ```

5. **Add Environment Variables**:
   - You need to add the RabbitMQ connection details (from your `.env` file) to Koyeb.
   - In the **Environment Variables** section, add:
     - `RABBITMQ_URL` with your RabbitMQ connection string (e.g., `amqp://guest:guest@your_rabbitmq_host:5672`)
     - `QUEUE_NAME` with the name of your queue.

6. **Create the Service**:
   - Click **Create Service** to deploy it.
   - Koyeb will pull the code from GitHub, build it, and run it as a worker.

#### 4. **Monitor Your Worker on Koyeb**

After the worker is deployed:
- You can monitor logs directly in the Koyeb dashboard to see if it's consuming messages properly.
- If there are any issues with the deployment, the logs will provide debugging information.

#### 5. **Test the Worker with RabbitMQ**

Now that your worker is deployed:
- Send messages to your RabbitMQ queue and verify that the worker deployed on Koyeb is consuming them.
- You can use a tool like `RabbitMQ Management Console` or a simple publisher script to push messages to the queue.

### Recap:
1. **Create a RabbitMQ worker using Node.js** and connect it to RabbitMQ with the `amqplib` package.
2. **Push the code to GitHub**.
3. **Deploy the worker on Koyeb** using the GitHub integration.
4. Set environment variables in Koyeb for RabbitMQ connection details.
5. **Monitor the logs** in Koyeb to verify that the worker is running and consuming messages from RabbitMQ.

By following these steps, you can easily set up a RabbitMQ consumer in a background worker service on Koyeb. Let me know if you need further assistance!
